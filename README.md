# Bash RNG glitch

I generated 3 set of random numbers using: MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports, 2,5 GHz Dual Core i7). First two sets wew generated using commands:
```bash
watch -c 'echo $RANDOM >> bash1.txt';
watch -c 'echo $RANDOM >> bash2.txt';
```
There were generated parallel, in two separate tmux sessions.

[bash1.txt](./bash1.txt)
[bash2.txt](./bash2.txt)


Third set was generated by following Python script:
```python
from random import random

for x in range(0,10000):
    print(str(random()*32767).split('.')[0])
```
